# Instagram-Web-Scraper
For this project I wanted to investigate how to get the best engagement on Instagram as a makeup influencer. Examining the patterns of these influencers helped me understand the steps to take in order to reach higher audiences and what the characteristics of viral posts are. The goal of this project was to  find the average time most creators post, which hashtags produce the most likes, and the type of content that produces the most likes.
